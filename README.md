## 📖 About

Video games store their assets in specialized, usually undocumented formats for models, textures, animations, audio, archives, scripts, and level data.

This list is for developers and modders working with such formats. It provides tools and knowledge to understand, extract, convert, and work with them across many games and engines.

**Contributions are welcome!** Submit pull requests to add new tools, documentation, or corrections.
